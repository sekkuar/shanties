Running down to Cuba with a load of sugar,
Weigh, me boys, to Cuba!
Make her run you, lime juice squeezes,
Running down to Cuba.
Weigh, me boys, to Cuba!
Running down to Cuba

O, I got a sister, she's nine feet tall,
Weigh, me boys, to Cuba!
Sleeps in the kitchen with her feet in the hall.
Running down to Cuba
Weigh, me boys, to Cuba, hey!
Running down to Cuba

The captain he will trim the sails,
Weigh, me boys, to Cuba!
Winging the water over the rails,
Running down to Cuba.
Weigh, me boys, to Cuba!
Running down to Cuba

Give me a gal can dance Fandango,
Weigh, me boys, to Cuba!
Round as a melon and sweet as a mango,
Running down to Cuba.
Weigh, me boys, to Cuba!
Running down to Cuba

Load this sugar and home-ward go,
Weigh, me boys, to Cuba!
Mister mate, he told me so,
Running down to Cuba, hey!
Weigh, me boys, to Cuba!
Running down to Cuba
